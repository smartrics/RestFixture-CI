This module contains a working ant build file to verify integration
between RestFixture and FitNesse.

The build clones (via jgit-ant) FitNesse and RestFixture repositories, builds each codebase
then runs the RestFixture CAT tests.

The build should be triggered by changes to at least one of the codebases. Although, practically
running it once a day would be more than enough given how stable both RestFixture and FitNesse are.
